Projects:
* Classification of Mechanical Tools using CNN and Particle Swarm Optimization. Completed the project under supervision of Dr G. Karthikeyan, BITS Pilani. Performed multiclass image classification using CNN and applied the concept of Particle Swarm Optimization. Achieved performance of 93.14% while RMS Prop, Adam, SGD and AdaGrad optimizers had performance of 74%, 71.3%, 16.67% and 8.8% respectively.
* Computational Mathematics with Case Studies. Completed the project under supervision of Dr G. Karthikeyan, BITS Pilani. Conducted case studies on Image Deblurring and Data Clustering using MATLAB and Numerical Analysis techniques.
* Comparing Performance of Time Series Algorithms and Forecasting Stock Price. Completed the project under supervision of Dr Varinder Singh, BITS Pilani. Compared performance of simple moving average, ARIMA, VARIMA and LSTM for time series prediction.
