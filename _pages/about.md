Hi! I am Siddhant Setia. I am pursuing my Master of Science in Mathematics and Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. I am currently completing my final year thesis in the field of Continual Learning under the supervision of Dr Paul Rad from The University of Texas at San Antonio.<br/>

Since the day I started college my goal has been to explore the interesting field of Information Technology. Throughout the past four and a half years I have done internships, projects, courses and workshops in the fields of Automotive: Strength and Durability, Networking, Software Development, Blockchain Development, Artifical Intelligence, Big Data and Deep Learning. To consolidate all of my work done since the start of my undergraduate degree I have created a few pages.<br/>

Feel free to email me if you would like to discuss about Data, AI and any form of automotive racing.
