Hi! I am Siddhant Setia. I am pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Boston. I completed my Master of Science in Mathematics and Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India.<br/>

Since the day I started college my goal has been to explore the interesting field of Information Technology. Throughout the past five years I have done internships, projects, courses and workshops in the fields of Software Development, Big Data, Deep Learning,  Artifical Intelligence, Computer Network Management and Blockchain Development. To consolidate all of my work done since the start of my undergraduate degree I have created a few pages.<br/>

Feel free to email me if you would like to discuss about Data, AI and any form of automotive racing.
