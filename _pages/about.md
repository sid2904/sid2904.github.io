Hi! I am Siddhant Setia. I am pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Boston. I completed my Master of Science in Mathematics and Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India. I completed my Masters thesis in the field of Autonomous Vehicles under the supervision of Dr Paul Rad, Director, Secure AI and Autonomy Laboratory, University of Texas at San Antonio.<br/>

Since the day I started college my goal has been to explore the interesting field of Information Technology. Throughout the past five years I have done internships, projects, courses and workshops in the fields of Software Development, Big Data, Deep Learning,  Artifical Intelligence, Computer Network Management and Blockchain Development.<br/>

I have consolidated all of my work done in various pages so feel free to check them out and email me if you would like to discuss about Data, AI and any form of automotive racing.
