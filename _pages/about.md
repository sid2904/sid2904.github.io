Hi! I am Sid Setia. I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Boston under the supervision of Prof Junichi Suzuki. I completed my Master of Science in Mathematics and Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India. I completed my Masters thesis in the field of Autonomous Vehicles under the supervision of Dr Paul Rad, Director, Secure AI and Autonomy Laboratory, University of Texas at San Antonio.<br/>

I work in the field of Information Technology, where curiosity and a love for problem-solving drive everything I do. Over the past years, I’ve immersed myself in internships, hands-on projects, specialized courses, and workshops—building skills in Software Development, Big Data, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networking and Blockchain Development.<br/>

This site showcases the work I've done across these areas, neatly organized for you to browse through. Whether it’s diving into the latest trends in AI, exploring data-driven solutions, or geeking out over anything related to automotive racing, I’m always up for a good conversation.<br/>

Feel free to explore, reach out, or just say hi—I’d love to connect.
